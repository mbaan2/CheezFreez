        <p><h2>Did you know?</h2>
            Cheese is a <span class="highlight">very important part</span> in todays society! However, cheese has one major flaw. It goes bad. Dun dun dun. Dramatic pause.
            Here at Cheese Freeze™ we love cheese. So much that we want to protect <span class="highlight">every single piece of cheese</span> there is in the entire world. This goal is still not solved sadly.
            However! There is one way in which this goal could be met. Everyone in the world buying our patented product: <h2>CheezFreez&trade;</h2>
            This would not only <span class="highlight">solve the problem of cheese going to waste</span>. It would also solve the very real problem of our pockets not brimming with money. Which obviously needs to be fixed. Stat. If this whole thing sounds too good to be true to you then head on down to the bottom of the page where you can <span class="highlight">buy the CheezFreez™</span>. If you need more convincing then keep on reading my friend. If you after all of this do not buy the CheezFreez™ I can only assume you're a <span class="highlight">cheese violator</span> that we deem not worthy of our CheezFreez™ anyways.

    <h2>Apparant Issues:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The cheese looks too green.</li>
    <li>Not enough yellow colour.</li>
    <li>Will be in the trashcan shortly.</li>
    <li>Cheese to mold ratio is wrong.</li>
    <li>Doesn't look all that edible.</li>
    <li>It's not inside our CheezFreez.</li>
    <li>Probably has been refrigerated.</li>
    <li>Another case of wasted food.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Yep... It's Bad.</h2>
    <p>Oh my god would you look at that <span class="highlight">travesty</span>. Isn’t this just way too relatable? Have you ever experienced this yourself?<br><br> Is your food also up to <span class="highlight">no gouda?</span> Of course it is, everyone’s food is! And in Norway, especially the cheese. Our cheese “gulost” - a type of gouda - is in a packaging that is <span class="highlight">not sealable when opened</span>. This is a major societal issue because it leads to our cheese going bad at an incredibly fast pace.

    <p>As you see <span class="highlight">in the picture(s) above</span>, cheese, when unattended for an extended period of time, does go bad. It can be up to no gouda! And <span class="highlight">things could definitely brie better</span>.
        <br><br>Most people, when faced with such a scenario, would throw the cheese out. Us sorry Norwegians need a way to be able to stop all this cheese going to waste. Do you have something in mind that could fix this? <span class="highlight">Of course you don’t</span>, but we (fon)due!

            <p> Our device will be <span class="highlight">the first stop</span> on the way after opening the cheese and eating a part of it for the first time.

            <p>Our patented CheezFreez™ is nacho average cooling device: whereas silly refrigerators can’t even keep a cheese’s structure intact for a few days, CheezFreez™ freezes the cheese, keeping it <span class="highlight">perfectly tasty for much longer</span>. Silly refrigerators thinking they can do it all.</p>

                <p>Here at CheezFreez™ we take food waste seriously.  So seriously that we decided to actually do something about it. </p>
                <p>Enter: The CheezFreez™. A freezer so advanced, it freezes cheese. <img class="amazing" src="wow.gif"> </p>

                <p>Pros:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s cold.</li>
                    <li>It’s cool.</li>
                    <li>It’s cheesy.</li>
                    <li>It has labels in different compartments for different types of cheese.</li>
                    <li>We don’t discriminate between cheeses, all cheese matter.</li>
                    <li>It’s not a refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Cheese will not be wasted.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>Cons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nothing, really.</li>
                    <li><span class="tinyText">It may consume a lot of energy to have a separate fridge just for cheese since everyone already has a freezer, so it is kind of a useless product. But it still solves the problem which is food waste for specifically cheese. So, technically, it’s a <em>grate</em> solution for a very real problem.</span></li>
                </ul>


                <p>As you can see, the pros <strong>heavily</strong> outweigh the cons. </p>
